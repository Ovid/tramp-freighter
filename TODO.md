- Economy
  notes/realistic_economy.md
  We're a single-player game, so perhaps the more you sell or buy in a
  system, the more the prices drop or rise based on your individual
  activity, before slowly returning to baseline? That forces players to look
  for other places to buy/sell.

* Lots of HTML in tests (<div id ...). Refactor?
- Multi-route jumps?
- Needs a tutorial.
- Some kind of "Achievement" system (visited all stars, for example)
- Is there any reason to keep the old calculateGoodPrice() function now that
  we have dynamic pricing?
- Easy way to figure out which stars I can travel to.
- Travel indicator instead of instant travel?
- No messages occur when I can't refuel (100% or no money)

# Fixed

- Cargo
  - See cargo capacity and remaining capacity
  - Consolidate stacks if item and "bought at" are the same
- Fix star distances and locations.
